Version 1.0 Initial release 3/5/2009

Version 1.01 3/13/09 Fixed help pages to avoid overhang in automatically generated pdf manual. 
                     Upgraded codes to handle enzyme activity data. Broke mkGrids up into smaller functions.
                     Added TK1 example to ccems-package help page as a laptop example. 
                    
Version 1.02 3/20/09 A major bug in mkKd2Kj was fixed (factors were reciprocals of what they should be!). 

                     A new papers/BMCsysBio08 directory was added to include 
                     actively maintained derivatives of the original script Rt.r.

                     hubchar is no longer an option of mkg and is instead now always the first char of 
                     first name in strct, which should always be the root (i.e. free hub) name. 
                     
                     bug that kIC must be different from IC has been fixed
                     
                     a weights column is now allowed in the data dataframe. The weights are divided
                     by their means before entering the SSE to minimize their effect on SSE and AIC.
                     Since the weights multiply the residuals before their inner product is made to form 
                     SSE, the weights should be reciprocal std dev (not variances). In TK1.r v data 
                     with v<Vmax/2 is weighted more heavily than data with v>Vmax/2, i.e. 2 variance bins are used.
